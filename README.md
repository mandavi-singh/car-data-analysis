# car-data-analysis
This project involves a detailed analysis of a dataset containing information about various cars. The dataset includes features such as MPG (Miles per Gallon), horsepower, weight, acceleration, origin, and more.
2025

📌 Project Overview

This project is part of the Summer Analytics 2025 practice assignment series. It involves performing exploratory data analysis on a dataset of car attributes to extract meaningful insights.

📁 Dataset

File: Cars.csv (provided by Summer Analytics 2025 team)

Source: Dataset was directly provided by the organizing team of Summer Analytics 2025 for educational use only.

Records: 398 cars

Features:

mpg

cylinders

displacement

horsepower

weight

acceleration

model year

origin

name

🎯 Objectives

Understand the structure and features of the dataset.

Practice data cleaning (handling missing values, type conversion).

Perform group-based analysis and filtering.

Use matplotlib/seaborn to create meaningful visualizations.

Identify trends across time and categories.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

📊 Visualizations

Multi-line plot: Average mpg over the years by origin

Scatterplot: horsepower vs. weight (color by origin, size by mpg)

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repo.

Open SA2025_W1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Make sure Cars.csv is in the same directory.

Run all cells to view the analysis.

✅ Tasks Covered

Shape and column overview of dataframe

Indexing with car name / metric

Filtering conditions (e.g. mpg ≥ 35)

Aggregations (mean, max, median)

Answering guided analysis questions

Visual exploration of car features
